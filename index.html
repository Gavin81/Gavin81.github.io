            <p class="paragraph">
                Hello there, I'm Gavin Eyquem and, currently, I'm a Treehouse TechDegree Front-End Web Development student.
                My interests are varied, like snowboarding, walking in woodlands, fitness running and coding just to name a few.

            <h3 class="heading">My Experience</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">My experience or journey in coding started when I attended a college course in Visual Basic. I learnt 
                about programming in said language and passed the course with the intention of gaining a degree in Software Engineering.
                I attempted to enroll onto a Software degree but sadly events occurred that prevented me from doing so.
                After I couldn't get onto the Software degree, I enrolled onto an Open University software course, which didn't do well for me.
                I stopped doing the Open University and wondered what will happen next? Well, aftre a small search I discovered TREEHOUSE!
                At first I completed a few of the basic courses that Treehouse offered and discovered that I enjoyed it, so I decided to get onto the TechDegree
                and now I'm nearing the end of it!
