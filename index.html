            <p class="paragraph">
                Hello there, I'm Gavin Eyquem and, currently, I'm a Treehouse TechDegree Front-End Web Development student.
                My interests are varied, like snowboarding, walking in woodlands, fitness running and coding just to name a few.
            </p>

        <!-- my experience/code journey -->
        <div class="my-experience" id="my-experience">
            <h3 class="heading">My Experience</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">My experience or journey in coding started when I attended a college course in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/visual-basic/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">Visual Basic</a>. I learnt 
                about programming in said language and passed the course with the intention of gaining a degree in Software Engineering.
                I attempted to enroll onto the Software degree but sadly events occurred that prevented me from doing so.
                After I couldn't get onto the Software degree, I enrolled onto an <a href="https://www.open.ac.uk/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">Open University</a> software course, which didn't do well for me.
                I stopped doing the Open University and wondered what will happen next? Well, after a small search I discovered TREEHOUSE!
                At first I completed a few of the basic courses that Treehouse offered and discovered that I enjoyed it, so I decided to get onto the TechDegree
                and now I'm nearing the end of it! As I have developed my knowledge with Treehouse, I've also applied some of that knowledge to my own website
                which is about a theory in philosophy. This theory in philosophy is known as reincarnation and it is a subject I have been studying
                independently for a few years now and I will link it here <a href="intheory.life" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">intheory</a> should you have an interest or are just curious.
                Treehouse has taught me a lot and part of that is about how and where you've gone wrong and then how to fix it. For me, JavaScript became a bit difficult to learn so I had to take my time with it
                and learn about solutions being applied to problems that arose. To understand, to gain knowledge and evolve. I'm not a website designer, when I've completed my TechDegree...I'll
                be a website developer. In my units, I have shown that I can take a mock-design and create it using code.

            <p class="paragraph">
                The future or what's next. As I develop/progress, I'll go on to larger and larger projects/jobs.
                I anticipate robotics and software will merge together in the not-too-distant-future, perhaps in some ways
                such a thing has already happened but on a much smaller scale, who knows? The future of software is not entirely clear
                but ideas will develop. Software does and will continue to play a big part in our human lives, so the question that we
                can ask is 'what will we witness?'. I suppose the limits of our own imagination will show us.
